# ðŸ”’ Cybersecurity Tools - MAC Address Changer, Network Scanner, HTTP Sniffer & Port Scanner

## Description

Welcome to Cybersecurity Tools! ðŸŽ‰
This repository contains four essential tools for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals:

- MAC Address Changer: Modify the MAC address of a network interface.
- Network Scanner: Discover devices on a local network by scanning a target IP or IP range.
- HTTP Sniffer: Capture HTTP traffic on a specified network interface and identify potential sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
- Port Scanner: Scan open ports on a target and check for known vulnerabilities based on banners.

These tools are designed to assist in learning and exploring network security practices while maintaining ethical usage standards.

## Features

1. **MAC Address Changer**

âœ” Quickly change the MAC address of any network interface.  
âœ” Automate disabling and re-enabling of the specified interface.  
âœ” Simple and lightweight, built with Python. 

2. **Network Scanner**

âœ” Scan a target IP or range to identify connected devices.  
âœ” Displays device IP and MAC address.  
âœ” Built with the powerful `scapy` library for network packet manipulation.

3. **HTTP Sniffer**

âœ” Capture HTTP requests on a specified network interface.  
âœ” Display URLs visited by clients.  
âœ” Identify potential sensitive information like usernames and passwords.  
âœ” Lightweight and efficient.  

4. **Port Scanner**

âœ” Scans open ports on a target IP or domain name.  
âœ” Retrieves banners to identify potential vulnerabilities.  
âœ” Compares banners against a database of known vulnerable services.  
âœ” Multi-threaded for fast scanning.  

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/gabrielgonta/Cybersecurity-Tools.git
```

Navigate to the project directory :

```
cd Cybersecurity-Tools
```

Install dependencies :

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### 1. MAC Address Changer

1. Run the script:
Launch the MAC Address Changer with the desired interface and new MAC address :

```
python mac_changer.py -i <interface> -m <new_mac>
```

Example :

```
python mac_changer.py -i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
```

2. View help message:
To see all available options, use the -h flag:

```
python mac_changer.py -h
```

### 2. Network Scanner

1. Run the script:
Launch the Network Scanner with the target IP or range :

```
python network_scanner.py -t <target>
```

Example :

```
python network_scanner.py -t 192.168.1.0/24
```

2. View help message:
To see all available options, use the -h flag:

```
python network_scanner.py -h
```

### 3. HTTP Sniffer

1. Run the script:
Launch the HTTP Sniffer with the desired network interface :

```
python http_sniffer.py -i <interface>
```

Example :

```
python http_sniffer.py -i eth0
```

2. View help message:
To see all available options, use the -h flag:

```
python http_sniffer.py -h
```

### 4. Port Scanner

1. Run the script:
Launch the Port Scanner with the desired target and port range :

```
python port_scanner.py -t <target> -p <number_of_ports>
```

Example :

```
python port_scanner.py -t 192.168.1.1 -p 200
```

2. View help message:
To see all available options, use the -h flag:

```
python port_scanner.py -h
```

3. Detected Vulnerabilities :
If any banner matches a known vulnerability in vulnerable_banners.txt, it will be displayed with the port number.
